Hi! Iâ€™m a postdoc at **ETH ZÃ¼rich** curious about everything that makes forests tick, from how individual trees grow and survive to how whole ecosystems maintain their biodiversity, shift their ranges, and store carbon. I love digging into the stories hidden in tree data to understand how forests adapt and transform in our rapidly changing world.

When Iâ€™m off work, Iâ€™m usually outdoors, hiking along mountain trails on weekends, swimming in crystal-clear alpine lakes during the summer, or skiing through snowy landscapes in the winter.  

# ðŸ”¥ Areas of Emphasis
