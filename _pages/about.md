<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Hi! I'm a postdoc at **ETH Z√ºrich**, where I study how forests work ‚Äî from the lives of individual trees to the big-picture dynamics of biodiversity, species coexistence, and carbon storage. I‚Äôm fascinated by how forests change and adapt in a rapidly shifting world.

When I'm off work, I‚Äôm usually out in nature, hiking on weekends, swimming in lakes in the summer, or skiing in the winter. And when I'm indoors, you might catch me dancing to hip-hop ‚Äî my favorite way to recharge and stay creative.
