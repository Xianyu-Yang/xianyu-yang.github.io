Hi! I'm a postdoc at **ETH ZÃ¼rich**, where I study how forests work â€” from the lives of individual trees to the big-picture dynamics of biodiversity, species coexistence, and carbon storage. Iâ€™m fascinated by how forests change and adapt in a rapidly shifting world. When I'm off work, Iâ€™m usually out in nature, hiking on weekends, swimming in lakes in the summer, or skiing in the winter.

# ðŸ”¥ Areas of Emphasis
Forest Dynamics, Species Diversity, Species Range Limits, Ecological Restoration, Tree Demography, Life-History Strategies
